# Articles Discovery Engine

Search engine system for articles using the redis technology stack. A tool that extracts articles and streams this information to the redis cluster, where processing is done with Redis Gears to add the data as JSON documents in RedisJson and indexes it to enable search with RediSearch.

## How to run it locally?

### Prerequisites

- Go - v1.18.4
- Dotnet - v6.0.108
- Docker - v20.10.14 (optional)

### Local installation

Go to `/deploy/docker` folder (`cd ./deploy/docker`) and then:

```
# run docker compose or install redis manually
docker-compose up -d --build
```

Go to `/src/functions` folder (`cd ./src/functions`) and then:

```
# Run backend
- Go func:
cd ./src/functions/web-clawler-worker
go build ./cmd/main.go
func start

- Dotnet func:
cd ./src/functions/query-api
dotnet build
func start
```

Go to `/src/web/articles-discovery-ui` folder (`cd ./src/web/articles-discovery-ui`) and then:

```
# Run frontend
cd ./src/web/articles-discovery-ui
npm run serve
```
